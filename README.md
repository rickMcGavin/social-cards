# Social Cards

## Goal

Build a small project to ultimately practice patterns with React as described in [Simple React Patterns](https://lucasmreis.github.io/blog/simple-react-patterns/) by Lucas Reis.

## Current Status

In the spirit of Dave Ceddia's blog post [6 Fun React Projects You Can Build Today](https://daveceddia.com/react-practice-projects/), I wanted to build his small project _Social Cards_. This was simple enough, so I wanted to expand on it by using the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/api/). After making it work with 1 user, I am now loading in 6 users via the API. Currently it simply handles loading the API, and a successful API call.
